Character recognition is the set of process which together can classify the input character according to the predefined character layout or class. With the world moving towards digital revolution, there has been increasing demand of application through use of which all documents of importance can be converted into editable document and can be stored online. This may be done with the purpose of storing valuable data online, so that it cannot be lost, or for saving time and labor demanded in converting handwritten or typed documents into editable document. Therefore modern society needs the input text into computer readable form.
Character Recognition is a common method of digitizing printed texts so that it can be electronically edited, searched, stored more compactly, displayed on-line, and used in machine processes such as machine translation, text-to- speech, key data and text mining.
This method is a simple approach to convert the input text into computer readable form, which is derived from ideas of different researchers who has given their valuable contribution in developing algorithms for OCR. Some research for hand written characters has been also done by researchers with artificial neural networks.
Digital document processing is gaining popularity for application to office and library automation, bank and postal services, publishing houses and communication technology.
